## Read datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv into          yearly

# Print out yearly
yearly

## .... CODE FOR TEST 1 ^ .... 

## Adding a new column with proportion of deaths per no. births

## Print out yearly

## Setting the size of plots in this notebook

## This plots yearly proportion of deaths at the two clinics

## Read datasets/monthly_deaths.csv into monthly

## Adding a new column with proportion of deaths per no. births
monthly = monthly %>%

## Plot monthly proportion of deaths

## .... CODE FOR TEST 5 ^ ....

## From this date handwashing was made mandatory

## Add a TRUE/FALSE column to monthly called handwashing_started
  monthly = monthly %>%

## Plot monthly proportion of deaths before and after handwashing
ggplot(data = monthly, aes(x = date, y = proportion_deaths, color =  handwashing_started)) +

## Calculating the mean proportion of deaths before      and after handwashing.
monthly_summary <- monthly %>%

    summarize(mean_proportion_deaths = mean(proportion_deaths))

## Create the line graph.
ggplot(data = monthly, aes(x = dates, y = proportion_deaths)) +
    geom_line()

## Printing out the summary.
monthly_summary

## .... CODE FOR TEST 7 ^ ....  

## Calculating a 95% Confidence intrerval using t              .test 
test_result <- t.test( proportion_deaths ~ handwashing_started, data = monthly)

## Call Test Result.
test_result

## .... CODE FOR TEST 8 ^ ....

## The data Semmelweis collected points to that:

doctors_should_wash_their_hands <- TRUE
